## Difficulties and challenges
- I feel like this particular project leaves a lot to be desired, I couldn't add all the features I was hoping to add and some of the things here are just broken. Altough one week was plenty of time to do a
project of this size was enough, It was a hellish week all around and I hope whoever sees this project referes to some of my other project that are more complete and decent overall.
- I felt like the most difficult part of this project to me was passing the information from the database to the Razor Pages, deffinetly something to work on going forward
